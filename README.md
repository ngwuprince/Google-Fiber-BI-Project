# Google-Fiber-BI-Project
Project Background Information:
The team seeks to gauge customer satisfaction by examining the frequency of follow-up calls after initial inquiries. Leaders aim to uncover patterns in repeat calls, identify reasons, and implement improvements for an enhanced overall customer experience through a comprehensive dashboard.

**Project goals:**

In order to continuously improve customer satisfaction, the dashboard must help Google Fiber decision-makers understand how often customers are having to repeatedly call and what problem types or other factors might be influencing those calls. 

·       A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date

·       A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type

·       Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

·       Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls.

·       Explore repeat caller trends in the three different market cities

·       Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year. 

**The ask/metrics:**

·       Specific: BI insights must clearly identify the specific characteristics of a repeat calls, including how often customers are repeating calls.

·       Measurable: Calls should be evaluated using measurable metrics, including frequency and volume. For example, do customers call with a specific problem more often than others? Which market city experiences the most call? How many customers are calling more than once?

·       Action-oriented: These outcomes must quantify the number of repeat callers under different circumstances to provide the Google Fiber team with insights into customer satisfaction.

·       Relevant: All metrics must support the primary question: How often are customers repeatedly contacting the customer service team?

·       Time-bound: Analyze data that spans at least one year to understand how repeat callers change over time. Exploring data that spans multiple months will capture peaks and valleys in usage.
